## 01. About Me

I'm a skilled **full-stack developer** with 5+ years of experience in **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**, specializing in building dynamic, scalable web applications using **Next.js**, **React**, and **Node.js**. My backend expertise spans **PostgreSQL**, **MongoDB**, **TRPC**, and **Supabase**, with strong proficiency in Git-based version control.

I’m passionate about **clean UI design**, **modern web standards**, and building user-centric experiences. I constantly challenge myself with new technologies and hands-on projects to stay sharp and inspired.

Outside of tech, I’m deeply rooted in music. With over 12 years of **piano playing**, and a background in **music production** and **audio engineering**, my creativity is driven by both **code and composition**. This unique combo fuels everything I build.
