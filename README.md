## About Me

I'm a skilled **web developer** with 5+ years of experience working on websites and projects. Most of my experience surrounds designing and developing **web apps** for clients, helping them meet the goals of their business. I constantly challenge myself with new technologies and side projects to stay sharp and inspired. Unfortunately a lot of my work isn't public. I'm hoping to get the chance to work on more open-source projects in the coming years.
